# UniProjects
These are the projects on which I have worked during my last three semesters at Bahria University (Islamabad) 
The projects include :

1-> Chesscalibur : A 2-D chess game inspired in a retro mystical pixelated world.
2-> FactorialGenerator : A factorial generator that generates factorial of numbers from 0 to 99 in Assembly Language using Irvine Library.
